What I have for a sprite bouncing off the walls. There might have been an issue with the scaling of the sprite, because I had to reduce the speed height and width by 100 to get it on the canvas
The sprite stays on the canvas, however it gets stuck in the bottom right corner, bouncing in a small square.
A keypressed was also used to get the sprite back to 0,0
